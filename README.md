# Calendar App

## Description

This is my personal Calendar app, developed as my first solo React project. The app features user authentication with secure sign-in/login using encrypted passwords, as well as password reset and "forgot password" functionality, primarily implemented through React's user-auth.

### Key Features:
- **Calendar Display**: Shows months in individual cells, with each cell displaying the date and the number of events (if any) for that day.
- **Event Management**: Clicking "View" on any day opens an input form that displays all events for that day in detail. The form includes a date picker and event submission functionality.
- **Event Editing**: Double-click events in the input form to edit them directly, or use checkboxes and trashcan buttons on the right to delete events.
